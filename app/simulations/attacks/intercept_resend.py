attacks/intercept_resend.py — Eve's intercept-resend attack strategies

InterceptResend:  Eve intercepts every photon
PartialIntercept: Eve intercepts fraction η of photons — the interesting case

The key insight: Eve faces a fundamental tradeoff.
Every photon she touches risks introducing a detectable error.
But every photon she ignores gives her zero information.

This module lets you sweep η from 0 to 1 and observe that tradeoff.

class InterceptResend:
    """
    Naive intercept-resend attack.

    Eve intercepts every photon, measures in a random basis,
    then re-encodes and forwards based on her measurement result.

    Why this is detectable:
    - Eve guesses wrong basis 50% of the time
    - Wrong basis measurement collapses the photon to a random state
    - When Bob measures these disturbed photons (in correct basis),
      he gets the wrong answer 50% of those times
    - Net QBER contribution: 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)

    Information Eve gains: ~0.5 bits per intercepted bit
    (she's right when she guesses the correct basis)

class PartialIntercept:
    """
    Partial intercept-resend attack.

    Eve intercepts a fraction η of photons, leaves the rest untouched.
    This is the strategically interesting attack.

    At η = 0:    Eve learns nothing, introduces no errors → undetected
    At η = 1:    Eve learns maximum, introduces 25% QBER → detected
    At η = 0.2:  Eve introduces ~5% extra QBER — below noise floor for noisy channels

    The question: what is the maximum η before Alice and Bob can detect her?
    Answer: depends on their noise threshold.
    If channel noise is 2% and they abort above 5% QBER,
    Eve can intercept up to ~12% of photons undetected.

    This is the core tradeoff the analysis notebook visualizes.
