attacks/pns.py — Photon Number Splitting (PNS) Attack

This is the attack that breaks practical QKD systems.

The gap between theory and reality:
  Theory:   Alice sends exactly 1 photon per pulse → BB84 is provably secure
  Reality:  Alice uses an attenuated laser (weak coherent pulse)
            Photon count follows Poisson distribution with mean μ ≈ 0.1
            Some pulses contain 2 or more photons

What Eve does with multi-photon pulses:
  1. She sits on the channel with a quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement
  2. She measures the photon NUMBER without disturbing the quantum state
  3. For n=1 pulses: she must let them through (blocking reveals her presence)
  4. For n≥2 pulses: she splits off one photon, stores it in quantum memory
                     forwards n-1 photons to Bob (he notices nothing)
  5. After Alice and Bob publicly announce bases during sifting,
     Eve measures her stored copies in the correct basis
  6. Eve gets perfect information on every multi-photon pulse — silently

Why this is devastating:
  At μ=0.1, roughly 0.5% of pulses have n≥2 (from Poisson distribution)
  That's a small fraction but Eve gets PERFECT information on those bits
  with ZERO error introduction
  
  Compare to intercept-resend: Eve gets imperfect info with 25% error cost
  PNS: Eve gets perfect info for free on the multi-photon pulses

The fix in real systems: decoy state protocol (adds random μ variation
to let Alice and Bob detect channel statistics manipulation)

    Photon Number Splitting attack on weak coherent pulse BB84.

    Requires BB84 to be initialized with use_wcp=True and mu set.
    Single-photon pulses are passed through untouched.
    Multi-photon pulses: Eve splits, stores, and will measure after sifting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mu : float
        Mean photon number of Alice's source (should match BB84's mu)
    block_single_photons : bool
        If True, Eve blocks single-photon pulses entirely.
        This is a more aggressive strategy — detectable via lower key rate
        but Eve gets better information. Default False (passive attack).
